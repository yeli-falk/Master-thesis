**Alcohol effects:**
1. behavioural
2. physiological






Findings from the review *Eye tracking correlates of acute alcohol consumption: A systematic and critical review* 2000-2018


- 1 alcohol intake increases the lag between the body movement and the eye movement 
performed to adapt this body change (https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0033662539&origin=inward) 2000

- 2 alcohol intake reduces the accuracy of slow eye movements requested to perform a smooth pursuit, 
leading to higher rates of compensatory fast saccades -> increased motion parallax thresholds, reduced depth perception (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00767.x) 2004

- 3 gaze instability (nystagmus) (https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP273204) 2016

- 4 pupilatory diameter change (Ma, J., Ma, R., Liu, X., Wen, Z., Li, X., Wang, T., Han, W., Hu, W., Zhang, Z., 2011.
Correlation between heart rate variability and pupillary reflex in healthy adult subjects under the influence of alcohol.) 2011
#HARD TO USE DUE TO OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE PUPIL SIZE ??

(significance of difference in 1 2 3 4 ??? controversy from different authors)

- 5 memory deficit (focusing only on central/important parts ) (contradictive results found by the same group (Harvey et al))
**driving environment** https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076052781&origin=inward 2001
however different results here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hup.307

- 6 impaired ability to reprogram eye movement (similar to 1?) https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269881111400645 2011

- !! 7 the degree of linkage between eye and steering movements was reduced even at mild BAC (https://www.nature.com/articles/1301458) 

---

- !! 8 dilation speed (pupillary light reflex) https://occup-med.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12995-021-00330-2 2021
*try to use their data for classification?*
- blinking frequency? (to confirm)

!!!!eye movementsâ€™ impairment of intoxicated individuals did not reach significance when
compared with an age-matched sober group - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X13001868?via%3Dihub 2013

*fun fact: materials promoting responsible drinking might be counter-productive by increasing real life alcohol consumption :)*

?? Several studies show attention bias towards alcohol-related stimuli. Can alcohol presence (images etc) distract the driver??

QUESTIONS:
1. what alcoholic stage do these effects start in? is it only for acute alcohol consumption?



Did not find papers on classification using those factors

interesting paper about driving behavious analysis - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339125878_Random_forest-based_feature_selection_and_detection_method_for_drunk_driving_recognition
also here
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365100502_Driver_state_prediction_from_vehicle_signals_An_evaluation_of_segmentation_approaches
combine the data??

**Thermal**

Found a bunch of other papers on Drunk Classification using Thermal Imaging, which contain their own sober-drunk datasets
Might be a good idea to combine it all to verify their findings
