Ten subjects were included in the first human
subjects experiment, 9 males and 1 female. Seven subjects stayed
sober for the duration of the test, and 3 subjects were given
0.8 g of alcohol per kilogram of body mass. For intoxicated
subjects, alcohol was consumed in less than 15 min. The study
included a sequence where subjects entered a vehicle, sat down
in the driver’s seat, and performed a simulated driving task for
approximately 10 min. During this time period, sensor signals
and video recordings were continuously logged. Sober subjects
performed the task 5 times. Intoxicated subjects performed one
measurement before drinking and continued with a new mea-
surement every 30 min until their breath alcohol level was

recorded below 0.03 mg/L. Throughout the tests, an evidential
breath analyzer (Nanopuls AB) was used as a reference. A new
reference sample was taken before each measurement sequence.
All participating subjects were between 22 and 70 years old. One
recording from the human subjects experiment is presented in
the present report, showing data from an intoxicated subject.
More results from the study can be found in Ljungblad, Hök,
and Pettersson (2016). The camera used for video recordings
operated at 60 Hz.
