Data description: The infrared images used in this work were acquired by means of the Thermo Vision Micron/A10 Model infrared camera (18 mm, f/1.6) of the FLIR Company. Its operating wavelengths range from 7.5 to 13.0 microns. The obtained information is in the thermal infrared where the maximum of the Wien curve lies (9.5 microns for 300 Kelvin black body - Human skin behavior). In this experimental procedure forty-one people were involved, 31 males and 10 females. Each person consumed four glasses of red wine, 120 ml each (13% vol.), in one hour - time period (a total of 480 ml of wine i.e. 62.4 ml of alcohol). The first acquisition of 50 frames for each specific person was obtained just before starting alcohol consumption, whereas the second acquisition of 50 frames 30 minutes after drinking the fourth glass of wine. In each acquisition, a sequence of 50 frames was obtained for each person with a sampling period of 100 msec between the frames. The resolution of the infrared images is 128x160 pixels.

Data description: 46 individuals, 40 men and 6 women, were selected. The average age of individuals was 24 years with a standard deviation of approximately 3 years (the minimum age was 18 years, and the maximum was 29years), being in good health without problems related to alcohol consumption. This analysis was performed by ascreening test designed to exclude people who consumealcohol regularly.
Subjects attended the robotics lab wherethey rested for 30 minutes to stabilise the metabolism tothe temperature conditions of the laboratory. The subjectthen consumed a 355 mL can of 5.5° beer, waited another30 minutes in the laboratory, and then repeated the proce-dure until four beers had been consumed. See Table 1 forthe whole capturing procedure.Upon completion of the procedure, subjects with about0.8 g/L of blood alcohol (drunk) should remain in place untilthe alcohol percentage decreased to under 0.2 g/L. This wasverified by measuring with a breath test. It should be notedthat during the entire experiment a paramedic was in thelab to verify the status of the individuals.
The thermal camera used was a FLIRTAU 2 with a resolution of 640 × 480 pixels, a framerate of 30 frames per second, thermal sensitivity of 50 mK,and a spectrum range between 7.5 and 13.5 μm. The database included 46 individuals with five subsets, a total of 250images per subject and 50 images per subset. The set is clas-sified into 5 subsets: “Sober,” “1 Beer,” “2 Beers,” “3 Beers,”and “4 Beers,” corresponding to the procedure of capturingthe databas

We have built an experimental thermal infrared facial image database of 10 subjects (6 males and 4 females). 
The thermal images of each subject have been acquired both for sober condition 
and also for inebriation condition obtained after the person drank a specific amount of alcohol.

Data description:
Ten subjects (9 males and 1 female). Seven subjects stayed
sober for the duration of the test, and 3 subjects were given
0.8 g of alcohol per kilogram of body mass. For intoxicated
subjects, alcohol was consumed in less than 15 min. The study
included a sequence where subjects entered a vehicle, sat down
in the driver’s seat, and performed a simulated driving task for
approximately 10 min. During this time period, sensor signals
and video recordings were continuously logged. Sober subjects
performed the task 5 times. Intoxicated subjects performed one
measurement before drinking and continued with a new mea-
surement every 30 min until their breath alcohol level was
recorded below 0.03 mg/L. Throughout the tests, an evidential
breath analyzer (Nanopuls AB) was used as a reference. A new
reference sample was taken before each measurement sequence.
All participating subjects were between 22 and 70 years old. 
The camera used for video recordings operated at 60 Hz.
